                    Working with at-risk youth and families is not easy or quick. Over the years, we’ve refined our approach in 
                        order to reach the people in our community. Outreach in Blake Boultbee is critical in ensuring that disadvantaged
                        youth have the opportunity to get an education, join the workforce and raise a healthy family. BBYOS believes that
                        this requires intensive, multi-disciplinary work with a young person over a period of years. Many social service 
                        agencies focus on a particular area of outreach, such as life skills. BBYOS offers a full range of services needed 
                        by at-risk youth and families. </div>

                    <p>
                        Our integrated, comprehensive approach involves building relationships with our clients. 
                        Foundations of trust allow BBYOS counsellors to address the issues affecting a young person’s
                        life, encouraging the development of self-esteem and life skills. BBYOS can provide at-risk 
                        youth with: support for survivors of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; assistance in
                        developing parenting skills; help in finding an apartment or a job; counselling and education 
                        about drug and alcohol abuse; and active counselling and education in all areas of sexuality and 
                        sexual health. BBYOS does what it takes to give young people a chance to improve their lives – 
                        and everyone deserves that chance.

                    <p>
                        Two highly skilled counsellors (male and female, ethnically diverse) ensure that BBYOS is representative of, 
                        and accessible to, our community. Intensive long-term individual and family counselling/therapy helps our 
                        clients become emotionally and mentally healthier and more functional in school and work. It allows them to 
                        gain a greater self-esteem and identity and to have healthier relationships with peers and family members. 
                        Counselling also provides support for teenage parents, survivors of abuse and families facing drug and alcohol abuse.

                        We actively reach out to our target population by meeting them in places other than our office. BBYOS provides 
                        advocacy and support for clients in school, at home, with employers, and in times of conflict such as court 
                        and during incarceration. We help find independent living quarters for young people who must leave violent and
                        emotionally unstable home situations. We provide clients with emergency provisions and means of transportation 
                        (e.g. TTC fare) for school, work, and important appointments.

                        BBYOS provides pro-active counselling and education in all areas of sexuality and sexual health. Our goal
                        is the development of healthy sexual relationships and the prevention of AIDS and other sexually transmitted 
                        diseases. We seek to prevent crime by working with youth to address their behaviours, those that are detrimental 
                        to themselves and the community. We work to prevent drug abuse through counselling and education.

                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Bob was a 15-year-old resident of the Blake Boultbee community who used to pop in and out of our office. He knew that he needed help with his violent behaviour, lack of self-esteem and motivation, and was frightened about dropping out of school. He was seriously concerned about his personal relationships, particularly with girls. 
                            He soon disclosed that he’d suffered years of horrific abuse from his stepfather. 
                            During his first two years with us Bob was involved in a number of serious incidents resulting in awful battles with his family and in some cases, criminal charges. But also during this time we were able to keep working with him on staying in school, to focus intensively on his self-esteem issues and to deal with his history of trauma and abuse. Bob then entered into a serious relationship with a girl and so wanted to ensure that he did not repeat the abusive patterns of his own life.
                            After many years of regular counselling sessions, on his own and with and his girlfriend, Bob did complete
                            his high school diploma, pursued his passion in animation , has become a very responsible father of two 
                            wonderful children, and is working full-time as a card carrying CAW member for a large food distribution facility. Bob and Karen are now living non-violently with dreams of owing their own home in the not too distant future.</p>
